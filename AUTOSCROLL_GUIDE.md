# Autoscroll Guide

This guide explains how to use Lyra's autoscroll feature - THE killer feature for live performance and music therapy.

## Overview

Autoscroll automatically scrolls your chord charts at a steady pace, allowing you to perform hands-free without touching your device. This is especially critical for music therapists working with patients, performers playing instruments, and anyone who needs to keep their hands free during a song.

## Key Features

- **Smooth 60fps scrolling**: Butter-smooth animation with no jumps or stutters
- **Customizable duration**: Set per-song scroll speed using minutes:seconds or tap tempo
- **Speed adjustment**: Change speed mid-performance with +/- buttons (0.5x to 2.0x)
- **Pause/resume**: Tap anywhere to pause, tap again to resume
- **Manual override**: Manually scrolling automatically pauses autoscroll
- **Progress tracking**: Visual progress bar and time remaining display
- **Jump to top**: Quick button to restart from the beginning
- **Floating controls**: Unobtrusive overlay that doesn't block content
- **Haptic feedback**: Tactile confirmation for all controls

## Quick Start

### Enable Autoscroll for a Song

1. Open any song in text view
2. Tap the menu button (•••) in the top right
3. Tap **"Configure Autoscroll"**
4. Set duration using pickers or tap tempo
5. Enable **"Enable Autoscroll"** toggle
6. Tap **"Save"**

Autoscroll controls will now appear when viewing this song.

### Start Autoscrolling

1. Open a song with autoscroll enabled
2. Tap the floating blue play button (bottom right)
3. Song begins scrolling automatically
4. Tap pause button or tap anywhere on screen to pause
5. Tap stop button (red) to end autoscroll

## Setting Duration

### Manual Duration

Use the minute and second pickers to set exact duration:

1. **Configure Autoscroll** → Select minutes (0-15)
2. Select seconds (0-59)
3. See total duration update below pickers
4. Tap **Save**

**Common Durations:**
- **Short** (2:00): Fast songs, quick rehearsal runs
- **Medium** (3:00): Standard tempo songs
- **Standard** (4:00): Most worship/contemporary songs
- **Long** (5:00): Slow ballads, extended arrangements
- **Extended** (7:00): Very slow songs, medleys

### Tap Tempo (Recommended)

Estimate duration by tapping to the beat:

1. **Configure Autoscroll** → Tap the large tap tempo button
2. Tap 4 times in rhythm with the song
   - Can be to a recording
   - Can be while playing/singing
   - Can be from memory
3. Estimated duration appears
4. Tap **"Use This Duration"** to apply
5. Or tap **"Reset"** to try again

**Tips for Tap Tempo:**
- Tap once per measure (not per beat)
- Maintain consistent timing
- 4 taps = enough for good estimate
- Try singing/humming while tapping for accuracy
- Recording playback gives best results

**How it Works:**
- Calculates average interval between taps
- Assumes ~80 measures for typical song
- Provides reasonable estimate for most songs
- Can fine-tune manually if needed

3. Configure duration if not set
4. Restart app if needed

### Scrolling Too Fast/Slow

**Problem**: Speed doesn't match performance

**Solutions:**
1. Use +/- buttons to adjust during song
2. Reconfigure duration for song
3. Use tap tempo for more accurate estimate
4. Check speed multiplier setting (should be 1x normally)

### Scrolling Not Smooth

**Problem**: Jumpy or stuttering animation

**Solutions:**
1. Close other apps to free memory
2. Restart device
3. Check device performance (older devices may struggle)
4. Reduce app background activity
5. Ensure iOS is updated

### Auto-Pauses Unexpectedly

**Problem**: Autoscroll pauses on its own

**Solutions:**
1. Avoid touching screen accidentally
2. Disable manual scroll if bumping device
3. Check for case or stand interference
4. Ensure stable device placement

### Progress Bar Wrong

**Problem**: Shows wrong time remaining

**Solutions:**

2. Check speed multiplier is correct
3. Stop and restart autoscroll
4. Verify song content hasn't changed

### Can't Adjust Speed

**Problem**: +/- buttons don't work or disabled

**Solutions:**
1. Check not at min (0.5x) or max (2.0x)
2. Ensure autoscroll is active
3. Try speed picker instead
4. Restart autoscroll

## Best Practices

### Duration Configuration

- **Use tap tempo**: More accurate than guessing
- **Test during practice**: Verify speed matches
- **Adjust after rehearsal**: Fine-tune as needed
- **Consider variations**: Different performances may need different speeds
- **Round to :15 or :30**: Easier to remember (e.g., 3:30, 4:00)

### Performance Setup

- **Stable device placement**: Music stand, tablet holder, or stable surface
- **Adequate brightness**: Visible in stage lighting
- **Charged battery**: Full charge before performance
- **Backup plan**: Know songs without device if needed
- **Test before show**: Run through setlist once

### Speed Adjustments

- **Start conservative**: Can speed up easier than slow down
- **Small adjustments**: 0.25x increments usually sufficient
- **Watch first verse**: Tells you if speed is right
- **Adjust early**: Easier to fix at beginning than middle
- **Note for next time**: Update duration based on experience

### Interaction

- **Minimal touching**: Let autoscroll do its job
- **Decisive pauses**: Don't hesitate if needed
- **Quick speed changes**: +/- is faster than picker
- **Trust the system**: Focus on performance, not device
- **Practice gestures**: Tap, swipe become second nature

## Advanced Techniques

### Multi-Song Setlists

**Performance Sets:**
1. Configure all songs in set
2. Enable autoscroll for each
3. Set durations appropriately
4. Enable auto-start for smooth transitions
5. Practice set flow before performance

**Between Songs:**
- Stop current song
- Swipe to next song
- Auto-start begins new song
- Or manually tap play
- Quick transitions possible

### Tempo Variations

**Song with tempo changes:**
1. Set duration for overall average tempo
2. Use speed adjust for specific sections
3. Or pause during tempo change
4. Resume at new speed
5. Stop/restart if major change

**Building tempo (ritardando/accelerando):**
1. Start at base tempo
2. Gradually adjust + or - buttons
3. Or pause and skip ahead if slowing significantly

3. Adjust speed down to extend
4. Consider PDF for very long pieces

**Medleys:**
1. Combined songs in single chart
2. Set duration for entire medley
3. Or use multiple songs and quick transitions

### Teaching/Coaching

**Instructor use:**
1. Pause frequently for instruction
2. Jump to top for repetition
3. Slow speed for demonstration
4. Normal speed for full run-through

**Student practice:**
1. Slow speed (0.5x-0.75x) for learning
2. Gradual speed increase as proficiency improves
3. Full speed (1x) for performance practice
4. Faster (1.25x-1.5x) for challenge

## FAQ

### Does autoscroll work with PDF attachments?

No, autoscroll only works in text view mode. If you have a PDF attachment, use the text extraction feature to convert to text first, then use autoscroll.

### Can I use autoscroll with all my songs?

Yes, but you need to configure duration for each song individually. Use tap tempo for quick setup.

### What if my device is too slow for smooth scrolling?

Older devices may struggle with 60fps scrolling. Try closing other apps, restarting the device, or updating iOS. Very old devices may not perform well.

### Can I change duration mid-song?

Yes! Tap the orange timer button in autoscroll controls to adjust duration. Or use speed controls (+/-) to effectively change duration without stopping.

### Does autoscroll drain battery?

Yes, continuous animation uses more power than static display. Charge fully before performances and consider external battery for long sessions.

### Can multiple people use autoscroll on one device?

Autoscroll is designed for single performer use. For ensembles, each performer should have their own device with their own tempo preferences.

### Will autoscroll work offline?

Yes! Autoscroll is completely local and doesn't require internet connection. Perfect for performances in locations without WiFi.

### Can I export songs with autoscroll settings?

Autoscroll duration is stored with the song, but global settings are device-specific. When sharing songs, recipients will need to configure their own global settings.

### What happens if I get a call during autoscroll?

Autoscroll will pause when app goes to background. Enable Do Not Disturb mode during performances to prevent interruptions.

### Can I use autoscroll in landscape mode?

Yes, autoscroll works in any orientation. Landscape may provide better visibility on smaller devices.
