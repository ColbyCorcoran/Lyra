## FAQ

**Q: Can I edit the set list during a performance?**
A: No, the set list is locked during performance. You can navigate to different songs, but can't add/remove songs. End the performance to edit.

**Q: What happens if I get a phone call?**
A: If Do Not Disturb is off, incoming calls will interrupt. Enable DND before performing to prevent this.

**Q: Can I use Performance Mode in landscape orientation?**
A: Yes, Performance Mode works in any orientation. Orientation lock prevents accidental rotation.

**Q: Can I print the set list from Performance Mode?**
A: Not during performance. End the performance and use the Print Set feature in SetDetailView.

A: No hard limit, but sets over 50 songs may have slower set list loading. Typical performances (5-30 songs) work perfectly.
