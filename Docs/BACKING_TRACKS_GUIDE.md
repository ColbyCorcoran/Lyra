## Best Practices

### File Management

**Naming Convention:**

SongName_Vocals.mp3
```

**Organization:**
- Keep all tracks for one song together
- Use consistent naming
- Include version numbers if multiple versions
- Date backups regularly

**File Size:**
- MP3 at 192-320 kbps is fine for most uses
- WAV for studio/highest quality
- Compress long tracks to save space
- Keep original uncompressed versions as backup

### Audio Quality

**Recording:**
- Record backing tracks at high quality
- 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz sample rate
- 24-bit depth if possible
- Use professional tools

**Export:**
- Export at matching sample rate
- Use high bitrate compression (256-320 kbps MP3)
- Normalize volume levels
- Add fade in/out during export if possible

**Testing:**
- Test on actual performance device
- Listen with performance headphones/monitors
- Check on different speakers
- Verify no audio artifacts

### Volume Levels

**Mixing:**
- Leave headroom (-3 to -6 dB peak)
- Balance all tracks
- Don't rely on limiter/compression
- Test at performance volume

**Live Performance:**
- Set backing tracks 10-20% quieter than live instruments
- Adjust per venue acoustics
- Consider crowd noise
- Have volume pedal ready for quick adjustments

### Backup Strategy

**Always Have Backup:**
- Export audio files to Files app
- Keep copy in cloud (iCloud, Dropbox)
- Have backup device with files
- Print emergency chord charts

**Pre-Load:**
- Load all backing tracks before performance
- Test each one briefly
- Verify routing
- Close unnecessary apps
