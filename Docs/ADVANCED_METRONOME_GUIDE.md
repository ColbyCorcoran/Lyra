Bar 4: 4/4
Repeat
```

**Setup:**
```
1. Metronome → Mixed Meter
2. Add time signatures in order
3. Metronome cycles through automatically
4. Visual indicator shows current meter
```

### Custom Time Signatures

Create any time signature:
```
Beats per bar: 1-32
Note value: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32
Examples: 13/16, 15/8, 19/16, etc.
```

## Subdivisions

### Quarter Notes (Standard)
```
1 click per beat
Default for most practice
Clear, simple rhythm
```

### 8th Notes
```
2 clicks per beat
Doubles the click rate
Good for: Slow tempos, detailed practice
Example at 60 BPM: Sounds like 120 BPM
```

### 16th Notes
```
4 clicks per beat
Very fast clicking
Good for: Very slow tempos, micro-timing
Example at 40 BPM: Sounds like 160 BPM
```

### Triplets
```
3 clicks per beat
Divides beat into 3 equal parts
Essential for: Shuffle feel, swing, 12/8 time
Sound: "tri-pl-et, tri-pl-et"
```

### Quintuplets
```
5 clicks per beat
Advanced subdivision
Divides beat into 5 equal parts
Common in: Contemporary classical, avant-garde
```

### Sextuplets
```
6 clicks per beat
Very fast subdivision
Two triplets per beat
Common in: Fast classical passages
```

### Mixed Subdivisions

Create custom patterns:
```
Beat 1: Quarter note
Beat 2: Triplet
Beat 3: 8th notes
Beat 4: Quarter note
Perfect for complex rhythms
```

## Accent Patterns

### Built-in Patterns

**Downbeat Only** (Default)
```
Pattern: [Strong, weak, weak, weak]
Accents: Beat 1 only
Use: Simple timing, most common
```

**Backbeat** (Rock/Pop)
```
Pattern: [weak, Strong, weak, Strong]
Accents: Beats 2 and 4
Use: Rock, pop, most modern music
Simulates: Snare hits
```

**Every 2 Beats**
```
Pattern: [Strong, weak]
Accents: 1, 3 (in 4/4)
Use: March feel, strong pulse
```

**Every 3 Beats** (Waltz)
```
Pattern: [Strong, weak, weak]
Accents: Beat 1 every 3 beats
Use: 3/4 time, waltzes
```

**All Accented**
```
Every beat is strong
Use: Learning complex patterns
Emphasizes: All beats equally
```

**No Accents**
```
All beats same volume
Use: Advanced timing, subdivision focus
```

### Custom Accent Patterns

Create any pattern:
```
1. Metronome → Accent Pattern → Custom
2. Set number of beats (matches time signature)
3. Toggle accent for each beat
4. Save pattern
```

**Examples:**

Clave (3-2 Latin)
```
Beats: 8
Pattern: [X, , X, , X, , , X] (X = accent)
```

Complex Accent (7/8)
```
Pattern: [X, , X, , X, , ]
Grouping: 3+2+2
```

### Accent Sounds

**Different sounds for accents:**
- Accent: Woodblock (higher pitch)
- Regular: Click (standard)
- Or choose any combination

**Volume difference:**
- Accent: 90%
- Regular: 60%
- Configurable independently

## Count-In Features

### Basic Count-In

**Enable count-in:**
```
Metronome → Count-In → Enable
Bars: 1-8 (default: 1 bar)
When you press Play:
1. Count-in plays first
2. Then main metronome starts
3. Optional: Backing track/autoscroll starts after count-in
```

**Visual count-in:**
- Large numbers display: 4...3...2...1...
- Color changes per beat
- Flashes on each count
- Different color for last beat (warning)

**Audio count-in:**
- Option: Different sound than main click
- Usually higher pitch or different timbre
- Helps distinguish count from main beats

### Count-In Duration

**1 Bar** (Most common)
```
4/4 time: 1-2-3-4, then start
3/4 time: 1-2-3, then start
Quick, standard count-in
```

**2 Bars**
```
Gives more preparation time
Good for: Band performances, complex starts
```

**4 Bars**
```
Full phrase worth of count
Good for: Songs with pickups, ensemble sync
```

**8 Bars**
```
Very long count-in
Use for: Large ensembles, complex arrangements
```

### Integration

**Start Autoscroll After Count-In:**
```
Enable: Count-In → Start Autoscroll
Behavior:
1. Count-in plays
2. Autoscroll starts on beat 1
3. Perfect sync achieved
```

**Start Backing Track After Count-In:**
```
Enable: Count-In → Start Backing Track
Use case: Count-in for band, then track starts
Perfect for: Click + backing track setup
```

**Visual + Audio:**
```
Both enabled = Most information
Audio only = Focus on sound
Visual only = Silent counting
```

## Tempo Trainer

Gradually increase tempo for practice.

### Setup

```
1. Metronome → Tempo Trainer → Enable
2. Start Tempo: 60 BPM (where you can play it)
3. Target Tempo: 120 BPM (goal speed)
4. Increment: 5 BPM (increase amount)
5. Interval: 4 bars (how often to increase)
6. Start practicing!
```

### How It Works

**Example progression:**
```
Start: 60 BPM - Play for 4 bars
Increase: 65 BPM - Play for 4 bars
Increase: 70 BPM - Play for 4 bars
...continue...
Complete: 120 BPM reached
```

**Visual feedback:**
- Progress bar shows position
- Current tempo displayed prominently
- Percentage complete
- Estimated time remaining

### Tempo Trainer Modes

**Continuous** (Default)
```
Automatically increases every interval
No pausing
Smooth progression
Best for: Building muscle memory
```

**Manual**
```
You control when to increase
Button to advance tempo
Stay at tempo as long as needed
Best for: Mastering difficult passages
```

**Random**
```
Tempo changes randomly within range
Builds adaptability
Good for: Performance preparation
Forces: Quick adjustment skills
```

### Customization

**Increment Size:**
```
Small (2 BPM): Gradual, smooth progress
Medium (5 BPM): Balanced (default)
Large (10 BPM): Fast progression
Variable: Different increments per step
```

**Interval Duration:**
```
2 bars: Fast paced
4 bars: Standard (default)
8 bars: More time to settle
16 bars: Really lock in each tempo
Measures: Number of bars, not time
```

**Tempo Percentage:**
```
Display tempo as % of target
Example: 80 BPM at target 120 = 66.7%
Motivational feedback
```

### Practice Session Saving

**Auto-save sessions:**
```
Automatically saves:
- Start tempo
- End tempo

```

**Review progress:**
```
Metronome → Practice History
See:

- Best tempo achieved
- Average practice duration
- Improvement over time
```

**Session notes:**
```
Add notes to sessions:
- "Struggled with bridge"
- "Finally nailed the solo at 95 BPM"
- "Need to work on 16th notes"
```

## Troubleshooting

**Click not audible:**
- Check volume slider
- Verify not muted
- Check audio output device

**Tempo seems off:**
- Verify BPM setting
- Check subdivision (16ths sound fast)
- Ensure no tempo trainer active

**Count-in not working:**
- Enable count-in in settings
- Check count-in bars > 0
- Verify audio not muted

**Visual metronome laggy:**
- Reduce visual size
- Close other apps
- Disable complex styles

**Click track export fails:**
- Check available storage
- Reduce duration if very long
- Simplify tempo map

## Best Practices

### Daily Practice

1. **Warm up slow**: Start 20% below target
2. **Build gradually**: Tempo trainer recommended
3. **Perfect first**: Speed comes after accuracy
4. **Take breaks**: Prevents rushing
5. **Track progress**: Save practice sessions

### Live Performance

1. **Test before gig**: Verify click audible
2. **Backup device**: Extra phone/iPad with click
3. **Wired preferred**: Bluetooth can have latency
4. **Volume check**: Click loud enough, not too loud
5. **Practice with click**: Don't use it first time live

### Teaching

1. **Visual + Audio**: Students see and hear
2. **Subdivisions**: Help students feel micro-timing
3. **Slow practice**: Use tempo trainer together
4. **Custom patterns**: Teach complex rhythms
5. **Export clicks**: Give students practice tracks

## FAQ

**Q: What's the tempo range?**
A: 40-300 BPM. Extreme tempos (10-400) available in advanced mode.

**Q: Can I use metronome while backing track plays?**
A: Yes! Independent volume controls for both.

**Q: Does metronome drain battery?**
A: Minimal impact. Audio is efficient. Visual uses more power.

**Q: Can I export click track commercially?**
A: Yes, click tracks you generate are yours to use.

**Q: Metronome latency?**
A: <5ms typical. Wired headphones recommended for critical timing.

**Q: Maximum bars for mixed meter?**
A: No limit, but 4-8 bars practical maximum.

**Q: Can I sync metronome across devices?**
A: Not directly. Use Bluetooth audio for synchronized listening.
